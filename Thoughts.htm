			In my opinion, I say the nations because even though the countries, such as China, banned the trade of electronic waste, the industry is still continuing. Hence, the developed countries must keep the waste to recycle it in their own land without sharing it with the developing countries. Yes, it would be easier because it like border security where there is a less to little chance of smuggling things in or out. Since the nations are causing the problems, they should be willing to assist this problem. </p>
			<br/>
			Since the biggest producers of e-waste would discontinue exporting, the countries that import them would have a decrease in the profit of the industry, leaving it to slowly die out. Hence, I believe it would be successful in matter of time.

			<h5><b>Individuals can...</b></h5>
			<li>try to not replace electronics every time there is a new version out while throwing out the old one. </li>
			<li>instead of throwing it out, you can donate to a friend, family, or any charity that would be willing to use them. </li>
